### Project Overview

 To decipher a message that is received from the sender. Multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, will have a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. In this project, following concepts are used:
- String operations
- Conditional statement and loops
- File I/O
- Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Write a function that reads the contents of the given files.
2. Make use of messages of two different files which contain one number each. 
3. Apply a certain operation to extract our message(here integer division).
4. Substitute the message of the file for a secret message.
5. Again make use of messages from two different files. 
6. Compare the two messages and take only those words that appear in the first message but not in the second message.
7. Extract only those words from the message in the file that are of even length.
8. Combine all the message bits into a single message and write it in a file to get final message.
