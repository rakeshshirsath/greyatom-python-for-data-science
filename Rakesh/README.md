### Project Overview

 Problem Statement - 
You have been hired by the University of Data Science to manage their students' records. Your job is to create the simple student management system for the university. Let's try to build the system using basic Python operations.


### Learnings from the project

 Outcomes
After completing this project, I came to know how to solve basic Python problems. In this project, following concepts are used:
    
- Mathematical operations
-     List operations
-     Dictionary operations
-     String indexing and formatting


### Approach taken to solve the problem

Algorithm:

Step 1: New register is created by combining data from two classes.

Step 2: Updation in student's name is completed.

Step 3: Dictionary for each subjects is created to generate progress report which shows total and percentage of student.
